Access Credentials Management

This page explains how the toolkit manages network access credentials.

Ansible Vault
-------------

This plugin handles user authentication by way of using user credentials located in
Ansible Vault files. By default, the plugin looks up user credentials in
``~/.ansible.vault.yml`` file. The ``safe`` option points to the default location of
the file.

A user creates the file by running ``ansible-vault create ~/.ansible.vault.yml``
command. Upon the creation of the file, the Ansible Vault prompts the user of a
password. This password is used to decrypt the content of the vault.

The encrypted file is a plain text file. The first line of the file contains a header.
The header specifies the version of Ansible Vault, encryption type, and looks like this.

.. code-block:: text

   $ANSIBLE_VAULT;1.1;AES256

A user edits the file with ``ansible-vault edit ~/.ansible.vault.yml`` command.

A user may save the password to unlock the vault in ``~/.ansible.vault.key`` file.
By default, the plugin uses ``lockpick`` option to determine the location of the
file unlocking the vault.

For example, the below instruction tells the plugin that the password for the vault
is located in ``/opt/admin/unlock.key``. The authentication credentials for the task
are located in ``/opt/admin/auth.yml``.


.. code-block:: yaml

   - name: collect data from network nodes
     action: ndmtk output="/tmp/data" safe="/opt/admin/auth.yml" lockpick="/opt/admin/unlock.key"

Credentials Structure and Format
--------------------------------

The expected way to store access credentials is in YAML format. The data structure
used is a list of hashes, where each hash represents a single credentials set.

Each hash in the list contains a subset of the following fields:

- ``regex`` (regular expression): if the regular expression in this field in a hash
  matches the FQDN or short name of a device, then the hash is preferred over any
  any other hash having the same or higher priority. However, if there is no match,
  then the hash is not used.
- ``priority`` (numeric): the field prioritizes the use of credentials. The entry with
  lower priority is preferred over the entry with higher priority when multiple entries
  match a regular expression pattern.
- ``default`` (boolean): if this field is present and it is set to `yes`, then this
  credential will be used in the absense of a `regex` match.
- ``description`` (text, optional): it provides an explanation about an entry.
- ``username``
- ``password``
- ``enable``: this credential is used when prompted to provide enable password.
  currently, there is no distinction between enable levels.

In the below example a user entered two sets of credentials. The first entry is used
for a specific device, i.e. ``ny-fw01``. The second entry is used by default when there
is no regular expression matching network device host name.

.. code-block:: yaml

   ---
   credentials:
   - regex: ny-fw01
     username: admin
     password: 'NX23nKz!'
     password_enable: '3nKz!NX2'
     priority: 1
     description: NY-FW01 password
   - default: yes
     username: greenpau
     password: 'My#DefaultPass'
     password_enable: 'Enabled#By$Default'
     priority: 1
     description: my default password

Considerations:

- There should be no ``default`` credential with the same ``priority`` level.
- There should be no credential with both ``regex`` and ``default`` fields present

Multi-factor Authentication Internals
-------------------------------------

When an Ansible playbook contains tasks related to ``ndmtk`` plugin, Ansible
invokes ``ndmtk`` callback plugin. The plugin performs lookup the lookup of
access credentials in Ansible Vault.

By default, the plugin looks for ``safe`` and ``lockpick`` task arguments. If they
are not defined, the plugin attempts to read ``~/.ansible.vault.yml`` (safe) and
``~/.ansible.vault.key`` (lockpick) files. The looked up access credentials are stored
in ``task['args']['credentials']`` list and passed to ``ndmtk`` action plugin.

The action plugin invokes ``_load_credentials()`` function to parse the list.
The function returns a list of dictionaries.

.. code-block:: json

    [
     {u'description': u'SDN Production Cisco Nexus Leaf Switches',
      u'password': u'pin,token',
      u'password_enable': u'pin,token',
      u'pin': u'4526',
      u'priority': 1,
      u'regex': u'^ny-fw02$',
      u'token': u'~/token.bypass',
      u'username': u'greenpau'},
     {u'default': True,
      u'description': u'my default password',
      u'password': u'POC123',
      u'password_enable': u'POC123',
      u'priority': 1,
      u'username': u'admin'}
    ]

When the plugin prepares for the connectivity it takes out one access
credentials set (FIFO) and puts it in ``self.activekey`` variable.

Later, when prompted for the password by a remote device. It fetches the
credentials from that variable using ``_get_item_from_key()`` function.

When a credential set fails, the plugin will lookup additional credentials.

.. code-block:: bash

    fatal: [ny-fw02]: FAILED! => {
        "changed": false,
        "data_dir": "/opt/data/ansible/poc-conf-20170221190959/ny-fw02",
        "failed": true,
        "junit": "/opt/data/ansible/poc-conf-20170221190959/ny-fw02/ny-fw02.junit.xml",
        "msg": "authentication failed",
        "temp_dir": "/Users/greenpau/.ansible/tmp/ndmtk/56cce459-f869-11e6-94e9-f45c89b1bb39/56d9c178-f869-11e6-a3a9-f45c89b1bb39/ny-fw02"
    }

When dealing with credentials requiring PIN and Soft or Hard Token, a user
must provide the path to read tokens via ``token`` key inside of access
credentials hash. For example, the below hash instructs the plugin to
user PIN plus Token combination for password. The PIN is ``1234`` and
the token can be found in ``~/token.bypass``.

.. code-block:: yaml

    - regex: '^ny-fw01$'
      username: 'greenpau'
      password: 'pin,token'
      password_enable: 'pin,token'
      token: '~/.token.bypass'
      pin: '1234'
      priority: 1
      description: 'Token-authenticated device'

A user populates the ``~/token.bypass`` file via CLI command. For example, the
below command send Token ``4562356`` to ``~/token.bypass``. Additionally, the user
specifies the amount of time the Token will be active, i.e. ``10``. The plugin
uses the information to determine whether the token is valid or not.

.. code-block:: bash

    date "+%s;572680;10" > ~/.token.bypass
